# Topic-Modelling

I did this project as part of my research into biomedical NLP applications at UCLA. The task was to find topics in an unstructured medical report and then use the topics to aggregate similar reports.

My findings are consolidated in the report. Overall, the output of LDA was pleasantly surprisingly since biomedical language is much different than the colloquial and prose vernacular.
